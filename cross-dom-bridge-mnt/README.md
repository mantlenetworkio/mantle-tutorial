# Bridging MNT with the Mantle SDK

This tutorial teaches you how to use the mantleio SDK to transfer MNT between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

## Setup

1. Ensure your computer has:

   - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
   - [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. Start L1 and L2 environments. Currently, we support the local environment or the testnet environment. If you want to deploy your own L1 and L2, please follow the instructions below.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2.git
   cd mantle/ops
   make up
   # check status
   make ps
   ```
   **We highly recommend using the testnet environment which can be applied [here](https://www.alchemy.com/).**
3. Clone this repository and enter it.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial.git
   cd mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-mnt
   ```

4. Install the necessary packages.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

## Run the sample code

The sample code is in `index.js`, execute it.
This transaction should execute immediately after execution.

### Node Environment

If you want to test by using your own nodes, you should configure the missing or changing environment variables in file `.env.local.tmp` then use `yarn local` to execute `index.js`. If you want to have a test in our testnet network you should do the same for `.env.testnet.tmp` and then use `yarn testnet` to execute `index.js`.

```sh
  yarn testnet
```

## How does it work?

```js
#! /usr/local/bin/node

const ethers = require("ethers");
const mantleSDK = require("@mantleio/sdk");
const fs = require("fs");
```

In this tutorial, we initialize the required libraries:

- `ethers`: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for tasks like creating wallets, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

- `mantleSDK`: The Mantleio SDK, which facilitates cross-chain transactions between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. It abstracts away complexities, making it easier to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing assets.

- `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module for file system operations. It may be used later in the code for reading or writing files, although it's not explicitly used in the provided snippet.

Next, the code defines some configuration parameters:

```javascript
const L1TestERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("TestERC20.json"));
const l1MntAddr = process.env.L1_MNT;
const l2MntAddr = process.env.L2_MNT;
const key = process.env.PRIV_KEY;
```

- `L1TestERC20`: A JSON object representing the L1 Test ERC20 contract.
- `l1MntAddr`: The address of the L1 MNT token.
- `l2MntAddr`: The address of the L2 MNT token.
- `key`: The private key retrieved from the environment variables.

```js
// Global variable because we need them almost everywhere
let crossChainMessenger;
let ourAddr; // Our address
```

- `crossChainMessenger`: A global variable initialized later in the `setup` function, representing the Mantle SDK's `CrossChainMessenger` object.

- `addr`: A variable that will store the user's address.

### `CreateWallet`

Initialize the signers of L1 and L2

```js
const l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC);
const l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC);
const l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l1RpcProvider);
const l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l2RpcProvider);
```

### `setup`

This function sets up the parameters we need for transfers then deploy ERC20 on L1 and L2.

```js
const setup = async () => {
  ourAddr = l1Wallet.address;
  crossChainMessenger = new mantleSDK.CrossChainMessenger({
    l1ChainId: process.env.L1_CHAINID,
    l2ChainId: process.env.L2_CHAINID,
    l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet,
    l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet,
    bedrock: true,
  });
  l1Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l1MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l1Wallet);
};
```

- `setup` function: Initializes the user's address (`addr`) and the `CrossChainMessenger` object for interacting with Mantle's cross-chain functionalities.

### `reportBalances`

This function reports the MNT balances of the address on both layers.

```js
const reportBalances = async () => {
  const l1Balance = (await l1Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18);
  const l2Balance = (await crossChainMessenger.l2Signer.getBalance())
    .toString()
    .slice(0, -18);
  console.log(`Token on L1:${l1Balance}     Token on L2:${l2Balance}`);
};
```

### `depositMNT`

This function shows how to deposit MNT from L1 to L2.

```js
console.log("#################### Deposit MNT ####################");
await reportBalances();
```

To show that the deposit actually happened we show before and after balances.

```js
// Need the l2 address to know which bridge is responsible
const allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20(
  l1MntAddr,
  l2MntAddr,
  depositToken
);
await allowanceResponse.wait();
```

We need to make sure the allowance is approved.
We can do that by sending an approval transaction on L1.

```js
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);

const response = await crossChainMessenger.depositMNT(depositToken);
```

`crossChainMessenger.depositMNT()` creates and sends the deposit transaction on L1.

```js
console.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`);
await response.wait();
```

Of course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.

```js
console.log("Waiting for status to change to RELAYED");
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(
  response.hash,
  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED
);
```

After the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2.
To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed.

```js
await reportBalances();
console.log(`depositMNT took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\n`);
```

Once the message is relayed the balance change on L2 is practically instantaneous.
We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1.

### `withdrawMNT`

This function shows how to withdraw MNT from L2 to L1.
For deposits, it was enough to transfer 1 to show that the L2 balance increases.
However, in the case of withdrawals the withdrawing account needs to be pay for finalizing the message, which costs more than that.

```js
console.log("Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE");
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(
  response.hash,
  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE
);
```

We need to wait until the message is ready to prove.

```js
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.proveMessage(response.hash);

console.log("In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY");
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(
  response.hash,
  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY
);
```

Wait until the state that includes the transaction gets past the challenge period, at which time we can finalize (also known as claim) the transaction.

```js
console.log("Ready for relay, finalizing message now");
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response.hash);

console.log("Waiting for status to change to RELAYED");
console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);
await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(
  response,
  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED
);
```

Finalizing the message also takes a bit of time.

### `main`

A `main` to run the setup followed by both operations.

```js
const main = async () => {
  await setup();
  await depositMNT();
  await withdrawMNT();
};

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

## Conclusion

You should now be able to write applications that use our SDK and bridge to transfer MNT between layer 1 and layer 2.
